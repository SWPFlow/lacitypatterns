## City of Los Angeles Pattern Library

GovStyle LA / Style LA

Take part in a unique opportunity to help unify and improve the design and usability of City of LA websites and apps.  The City’s Web Team has been working on a proposed Style Guide to be used as the go-to style resource for all site and app development.  Not only is this Style Guide supposed to help streamline development, but it should provide great-looking style that can be used by all City Departments while ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
